Compulsory Task 1* For the first task, what I found interesting about the similarities between cat, monkey, and banana is that they all belong to different categories. Cat and monkey are living organisms, while banana is a fruit. However, all three words share a common feature: they are all commonly used in English language education materials to teach children vocabulary. The reason for this is likely because all three words are easy to pronounce and have a simple, memorable spelling.As for an example of my own, one similarity I find interesting is the connection between music and emotions. Music has the ability to evoke different emotions in people, and this phenomenon has been studied extensively in the fields of psychology and neuroscience. Certain types of music, such as classical or ambient, are often associated with relaxation and calmness, while other genres, such as heavy metal or rap, can evoke feelings of excitement or even aggression. * 'en_core_web_sm' / 'en_core_web_md'One noticeable difference I found was that the 'en_core_web_sm' model produced less detailed and less accurate results than the 'en_core_web_md' model. For example, when processing the sentence "John Smith is a software engineer", the 'en_core_web_sm' model only identified "John Smith" as a person, while the 'en_core_web_md' model correctly identified "software engineer" as the person's occupation. Additionally, the 'en_core_web_md' model provided more detailed information about named entities and part-of-speech tagging. This suggests that the larger model is more effective at handling complex text and identifying nuances in language.
